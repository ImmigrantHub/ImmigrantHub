# ImmigrantHub
LiveJournal for immigrants. Let others benefit from you story, and get connected to those who will advocate for you during the process.
2017 "I Stand With Immigrants" Hackathon project

## Vision:
* Foster community: 
  1. Users track their process timeline and share their stories at each step of the way.
  2. Stories are marked with relevant tags such as "DOCA", "Latin America", "NYC". 
  3. Others can search these tags to find those in their community and read the stories of those with experiences similar to their own. 
* Provide avenue for advocate groups and individuals in need to connect: 
  1. User's can mark their timeline with a "Help" beacon. 
  2. Adocacy groups can subscribe to tags, and if a story with matching tag is marked with a beacon, the group will be alerted and be able to connect through the platform to offer existance. 
* Collect data and user stories to provide context around this data: 
  1. Because users are tracking their progress in real time, we'll have access to data showing that for people from this country, activity 'X' typically takes Y number of years, but are most often stymied at activity 'Z'. This data will come with built in context, providing a more clear narrative for those of us who don't understand the true problems in the system.
